# MainSignalServer

A Hub allows the client and server to call methods to each other directly. SignalR uses a Hub instead of controllers like in ASP.NET MVC. For that, we need to create a class that will inherit from the Hub class.

now just give the command below in the terminal, and it will be running.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6 SDK
- ASP.NET Core, SignalR

### Running the Server
```bash
dotnet watch run
